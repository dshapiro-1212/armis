*SQL examples based on an imaginary table like this one called “Device Usage Data” (dbo.device_usage_data)

#column headers
Date	Device_ID	Device_Type	IP_Address	manufacturer
				



*Example 1: Which IP Addresses have been associated with at least 5 devices in the last 30 days?

Select distinct IP_Address, count(distinct Device_ID) as devices
From dbo.device_usage_data
where date >= DATEADD(day,-30,getdate())
Group by IP_Address
Having count(distinct Device_ID) >= 5


*Example 2: What is the total % of total devices broken out by device type?

Select distinct Device_Type, 
count(distinct Device_ID) ad total_devices, 
(count(distinct Device_ID) * 100 / (sum(count(distinct Device_ID)) over ()) as percent_of_total
From dbo.device_usage_data
Group by Device_Type


*Example 3: For each Ip Address, break out # of devices by a few specific device types:

Select distinct ip address, 

Count(distinct(case when device_type like ‘Medical Device’ 
then Device_ID end)) as medical_devices,

Count(distinct(case when device_type like ‘Cell Phone’ 
then Device_ID end)) as cell_phones,

Count(distinct(case when device_type like ‘Tesla Car’ 
then Device_ID end)) as tesla_cars

from dbo.device_usage_data
group by ip_address



*Example 4: Which devices were associated with the same IP Address at least 7 days in a row during the month of March?

--step 1:

With dates(date, Device_ID, IP_Address) as 
	
	(Select distinct cast(date as date), Device_ID, IP_Address
	From dbo.device_usage_data
	Where date between ‘3-1-2020’ and ‘3-31-2020),

groups as
(select distinct Device_ID, IP_Address, 
row_number() over (order by date) as rn,
dateadd(day, -ROW_Number() Over (Order by Device_ID, IP_Address, date),date) as grp,
date
from dates)

select distinct Device_ID, IP_Address, count(*) as consecutiveDates, 
min(date) as startdate, max(date) as enddate
into #streaks_by_Device_and_IP
from groups
group by grp, Device_ID,  IP_Adress


--step 2:

select distinct * 
from #streaks_by_Device_and_IP
where consecutiveDates >= 7
